# Server Components Working Group

This is the working group for React Server Components. The working group is focused around online conversations which you can access by going to the [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions).

The working group is structured to help manage discussions yet make the information available to everyone.

Working group participants can start GitHub discussions to raise questions and share research. They can also comment on existing discussion threads. All discussions are public and available for everyone to follow along.
